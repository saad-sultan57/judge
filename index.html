                    <p>Philippe Bruyninckx is a Belgian, lives 40 km east of Brussels. From my childhood I was raised between the perfumes my mother sold. So my nose was very well trained from very young, an advantage I am still happy with. For many years I worked in product engineering but switched to independent worker in 2012. I have a degree in Biochemistry and have a company in telemarketing for scientifical (laboratory) equipment. The love for EVOO started 30 years ago in Crete. I always want to know more about it, but professional reasons didn’t allow me to do that. To know more and better understand this great product I went to ONAOO in 2015 and became technical olive oil taster. In 2018 I succeeded and got the degree of professional olive oil taster at ONAOO. Up to now, I am the only one in Belgium. EVOO became a passion and the degree from ONAOO was the extra boost to spread the knowledge. I import extra virgin olive oils and olives from the Mediterranean. I give workshops and love to bring the knowledge about EVOO to the public. I am also a member and vice panel leader of the olive oil institute of the Netherlands. This gives me the opportunity for constantly tasting and judging different samples. The samples are the complete range in quality EVOO and unfortunately non EVOO.</p>
